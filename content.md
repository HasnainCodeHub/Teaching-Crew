# Generative AI Agents: A Comprehensive Guide

## Module 1: Introduction to Generative AI and Agents

### 1.1 What is Generative AI?

*   **Definition:** Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models capable of generating new, original content. This content can take various forms, including text, images, audio, video, and even code.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Learning from Data:** Generative models learn the underlying patterns and distributions from a large dataset.
    *   **Content Creation:** Based on learned patterns, these models can generate novel and realistic outputs.
    *   **Unsupervised or Self-Supervised Learning:** Many generative models rely on unsupervised or self-supervised learning techniques, allowing them to learn from unlabeled data.
*   **Examples of Generative AI Models:**
    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, competing against each other. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity.
    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs learn a compressed latent representation of the input data, which can then be used to generate new samples.
    *   **Transformers:** Originally designed for natural language processing, transformers have proven highly effective for various generative tasks, including text generation, image synthesis, and music composition. (e.g., GPT, BERT, T5)
    *   **Diffusion Models:** These models learn to reverse a diffusion process that gradually adds noise to the data, allowing them to generate high-quality samples by denoising.
